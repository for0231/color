Drupal 8 follows a SMACSS-style categorization of its CSS rules:

1. Base — CSS reset/normalize plus HTML element styling.
2. Layout — macro arrangement of a web page, including any grid systems.
3. Component — discrete, reusable UI elements.
4. State — styles that deal with client-side changes to components.
5. Theme — purely visual styling (“look-and-feel”) for a component.
